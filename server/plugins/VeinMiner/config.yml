#   THE HIGHER THE "MaxRadius" VALUE IS, THE MORE DECISIONS THE PLUGIN HAS TO RUN ON    #
#   BE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A RELIABLE SERVER HOST BEFORE INCREASING THIS FEATURE         #
#   THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT IS 4 BLOCKS. THAT SHOULD BE ALL YOU NEED                     #
#   THE RECOMMENDED MAXIMUM IS 7 BLOCKS. YOU MAY GO HIGHER, BUT BE CAUTIOUS DOING SO    #

# Also: Please note that REDSTONE_ORE and GLOWING_REDSTONE_ORE are the same blocks, but both are necessary in the list in order for it to work. 
# |-->  Reason: Touching a redstone block turns it into a glowing redstone ore, and the plugin needs to be able to detect both
